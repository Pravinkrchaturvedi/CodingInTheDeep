1. Explain how to solve the collisions in a hash table.
	Collision happens when two value has the same key, although they have different hash codes.
	Collision is solved by using a LinkedList to store the values with the same key

2. Time complexity of put a <K,V> pair into the map. Best? Worst? Average?
	Best: 
		O(1). use hash code to find the bucket index 
	Worst: 
		the 'put' triggers the resize of the hash table. In this case, a new bucket table 
	is created. It doubles the size of the original table and need to copy all data of the original
	table, hence O(n)
	Average: 
		O(1). Good hash table design improves the performance by choosing proper
	 initial capacity and load factor. Initial capacity is the initial length of the table bucket,
	 load factor decides when to resize the table bucket. Higher value of load factor decreases
