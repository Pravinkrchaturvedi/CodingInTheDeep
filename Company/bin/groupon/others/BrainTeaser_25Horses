Brain Teaser -- 25 horses

Given 25 horses, find the 3 fastest.
You have no timer and can know the relative order of 5 horses in a match.
What's the minimum number of matches you should have?

A:
Wrong: heap sort, merge 5 heaps, 5 + 3 = 8

Correct: 
Divide into 5 teams
a1>a2>...a5
b1>b2>...b5
c1>c2>...c5
d1>d2>...d5
e1>e2>...e5

with one more match, we can get the order of those horses ranking first in the match, we assume that 
a1>b1>c1>d1>e1
then a1 is the fastest, the candidates for second and third fastest are:
a2,a3,b1,b2,c1
We can get the second and third fastest by one match
so, 5+1+1 = 7
