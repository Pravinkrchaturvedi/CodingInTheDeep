   // Sol1
   // The naive solution is to find the water that can be trapped in each position.
   // More specific, for each position, find all the paths from it to the border of 
   // the matrix, we record the highest value on each path, and the final bar height
   // will be the minimum of those highest values.
   // time: O(n^4); space: O(1)
   
   // We can find that when we calculate the highest values on the path, there're lots of 
   // duplicate calculations. We can optimize Sol1 through this observation.
