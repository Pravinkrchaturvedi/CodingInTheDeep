Denormalized and Normalized databases:
	<1>	Normalized databases are designed to minimize redundancy, 
	while denormalized database are designed to optimize read time
	<2>	The drawback of normalized db is that many queries require expensive joins
	<3>	Denormalize the db by storing redundant data.
	
	
SQL statements:
	<1>	SELECT
		SELECT col FROM table	;	SELECT	* FROM table
	<2>	SELECT DISTINCT, only list the distinct ones
		SELECT DSITINCT col 
		FROM table
	<3>	WHERE
		SELECT	col	
		FROM table	
		WHERE  col operator value
		(opeartor: =, >, <, <>, >=, <=, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN)
	<4>	AND / OR
		SELECT	*
		FROM Customers
		WHERE	Country='China'	AND	(City='Beijing' OR City='Shanghai'
	<5>	ORDER BY : sort the result-set by one or more columns
		SELECT col1, col2
		FROM table
		ORDER BY col1, col2  ASC|DESC
	<6>	INSERT INTO
		INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, col3)
		VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...)
	<7>	UPDATE	: update existing table
		UPDATE table
		SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2
		WHERE coln = valn
	<8>	DELETE	: delete rows in a table
		DELETE FROM table
		WHERE coln = valn
		DELETE FROM table	DELETE * FROM table,  delete all rows
	<9>	INNER JOIN : intersection  (INNER JOIN is the same as JOIN)
		SELECT col
		FROM table1
		INNER JOIN table2
		ON table1.col = table2.col
	<10> LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
			LEFT JOIN: may have null value if there's no matching row in right table
			Predicate: the column to connect two tables (ON keyword)
	<11> AS 
		 SELECT col AS alias_name
		 FROM table
	<12> GROUP BY
		used in conjunction with the aggregate functions to group the result-set by one or more columns.

SQL Functions
	<1>	COUNT  :  return the number of values of a specified col
		SELECT COUNT(col) FROM table
		SELECT COUNT(*)	FROM table
	<2>	HAVING : the HAVING clauses was added to SAL because WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions
		SELECT col, aggregate_function(col)
		FROM table
		WHERE col operator value
		GROUP BY col
		HAVING aggregate_function(col)	operator value
