Binary Tree vs. Binary Search Tree
BST: left < root < right

Balanced vs. Unbalanced
Balanced tree: 
	depth of subtrees will not vary by more than a certain amount.
	it doesn't mean that the left and right subtrees are exactly the same size.

Full and Complete:
	have exactly 2^n -1 nodes
	
Binary tree traversal:
	in-order, pre-order, post-order

Tree Balancing: 
	Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees

Trie:

Graph Traversal:
	DFS
	BFS
	remember to mark the visited node to avoid cycle

As to the graph traversal, DFS uses less space compared to BFS
