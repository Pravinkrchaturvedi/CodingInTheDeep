Questions can be solved:
	when you solve the problem like "find nth number..." or "implement a method to compute all...", it's likely
	that this is a recursive problem

Approach:
	Base case + Build
	<1> Bottom Up:
			start with knowing how to solve the problem for a simple case.
			the key here is to think about how you can build the solution for one case off of the previous case
	<2>	Top Down:
			think about how to divide the problem for case N into sub-problems. 
			Be careful of overlap between the case.
			
Dynamic Programming:
	Recursive with cache			

Comparison with Iterative
	all recursive code can be implemented iteratively. So, it's a topic to talk with the interviewee.
