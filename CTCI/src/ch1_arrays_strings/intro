ArrayList:
	when the array is full, the array doubles in size;
	each doubling takes O(n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized time is still O(1)

Auto-boxing:
	cast primitive type into object so that it can be inserted into arrayList, map or set
	
StringBuilder / StringBuffer:
	StringBuilder provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, but with no guarantee of synchronization.
	When possible, it is recommended that this class be used in preference to StringBuffer as it will be 
	faster under most implementations.
