##Tree
basic algorithms: **DFS**(inorder/preorder/postorder in recursive/iterative version), **BFS**
#### 1. find a specific path in the tree
* Root to leaf path
<br>SumRootToLeafNumbers (Leetcode)
* Path between two nodes
<br> DistanceOfTwoNodesInBST (Company/amazon)
<br> 
* Path of maximum value in the tree
<br>BinaryTreeMaximumPathSum (Leetcode)
